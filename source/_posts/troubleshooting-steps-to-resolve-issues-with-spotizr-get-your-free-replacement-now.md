## Troubleshooting Steps to Resolve Issues with Spotizr - Get Your FREE Replacement Now!

### Overview

Spotify and Deezer are two different music streaming services. Music fans may subscribe these two music services and these users may want to combine the playlists from these two services into one. Spotizr just serves this purpose.

Simply speaking, Spotizr is a playlist converter which is used to convert Spotify playlists to Deezer playlists by importing Spotify playlist URL and syncing it to Deezer. But many users are reporting that Spotizr includes many bugs and sometimes Spotizr does not work to help to transfer the Spotify playlists to Deezer playlists. So want to use another software to listen to Spotify playlists on Deezer? If so, a Spotizr alternative - Allavsoft can help you.

### Spotizr Alternative - Allavsoft

* Unlike Spotizr, Allavsoft is not an online service to directly convert Spotify playlists to Deezer playlists. Allavsoft is an online music downloader which can download music from Spotify and then users can upload the downloaded Spotify music to Deezer to create your own Deezer playlists.
* Allavsoft can download Spotify music to MP3, WAV, AAC, WMA, etc to not only allow you to upload to Deezer, but also allow you to listen to the downloaded Spotify music on iPhone, iPad, iPod, Andoid, PS4, PS3, Zune, Roku, etc.
