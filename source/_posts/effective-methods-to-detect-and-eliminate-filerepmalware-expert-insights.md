Generally, FileRepMalware is categorize under detection name **Win32:Evo-gen \[Susp\]**. The initials of the detection, i.e., **Win32,** indicate that this cyber threat is limited to just Windows computer, and Mac OS systems are free of it. At the same time, the ending **Evo-gen** indicates a generic classification.

The file through which FileRepMalware is spread is KMSPico, which is the third-party activation tool for Windows and its application. Since the detection name is generic, FileRepMalware can be a trojan or any other dangerous malware. It is considered as a [PUP](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) because many commercial advertising started to appear on your system after its infection.

## How did FileRepMalware end up on my computer?

There are various ways through which FileRepMalware can get an entry on your device. The most common methods are:

1. When a user clicks on an [infected pop-up ad](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), the malware such as FileRepMalware gets installed stealthily.
2. It can also gain entry through a bundled software program.
3. The email attachments from an unknown source can also be a FileRepMalware carrier.
4. Peer to peer File Sharing networks such as Torrents are also responsible for FileRepMalware infection.
5. Fake updates and external media are another two common medium.

## How to Remove FileRepMalware?

If FileRepMalware has taken over your system, you can get rid of it using following steps:

### **Step 1: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Step 2: Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If FileRepMalware is still there on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.  
![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)
2. Watch out for the applications that are consuming the system memory even though you did not install or launch them.
3. Right-click on the suspicious application and open its file location.

4. Delete the file from its root location.

### **Step 3: Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

**1\. What is win32 Trojan Gen?** 

Win32:Trojan-gen is a heuristic detection designed to detect a Trojan Horse generically. 

**2\. Are keygens illegal?** 

YES, keygens are illegal because they are mostly used for cracking the official paid software for free.

**3\. Is KMSPico a virus?** 

KMSPico is identified as malware because it replaces the original key with the volume licensed key and creates an emulated instance of KMS server locally avoiding online activation. So your Windows system can’t connect to an online server and continues to work with that replaced license key thinking it as the original key.
