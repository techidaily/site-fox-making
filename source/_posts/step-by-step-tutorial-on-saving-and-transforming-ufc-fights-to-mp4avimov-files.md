## Step-by-Step Tutorial on Saving and Transforming UFC Fights to MP4/AVI/MOV Files

### Overview

* I get used to enjoying UFC boxing videos and yesterday I found some UFC boxing videos really interesting to me and I want to download them for offline playback. Can you tell me how I can download UFC videos to MP4 for playback on my Android phone?
* I need to download some UFC videos and edit them in FCP. What software can help me to download the UFC videos to FCP more supported ProRes?

UFC.TV is the service for users to watch UFC PPV online on which users can watch many live and archived event and videos. To take more advantage of UFC.TV service, many users prefer to subscribe UFC Fight Pass, a subscription-based video streaming service to allow users to enjoy the entire video libraries of over 30 other MMA/boxing/kickboxing/Muay Thai/Jiu Jitsu promotions via devices, like Apple TV, Android, Xbox, Roku, Chromecast, etc. But UFC Fight Pass can not help users to download UFC videos for offline purpose. So users who want to download UFC videos need help from another UFC downloader called Allavsoft
